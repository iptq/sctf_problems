Nothing to help here really.
You just have to find my address.
I personally did it by finding my dad's name using Facebook, and then using Pipl.
That doesn't get you the house number though. So, there's a few approaches to finding it.
You can check public records like property taxes, or you can try to cross-reference home sale dates with the next place I lived.
