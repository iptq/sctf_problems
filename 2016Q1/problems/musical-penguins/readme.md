This problem is a [Tux Guitar](http://tuxguitar.herac.com.ar/) file with notes corresponding to morse code. The trick is that the morse code translates into the base 7 conversions of the flag's unicode value.  
  
To solve it, competitors will have to first translate the notes to morse, then get the base 7 (indicated by the hint referring to the movie Se7en) numbers and convert them to base 10. Finally, they'll need to convert those base 10 numbers into characters to get the flag.
