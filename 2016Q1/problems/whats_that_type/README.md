# What's That Type? #

The problem is fairly straightforward. It amounts to writing a parser for the language as described
and then implementing Hindly-Millner type inference for it. After you've done that, you can parse
the given program, run type inference on it, and output the type. Then, you submit the type and
we grade it for correctness.
