#Schensted
This problem is solved by using [Schensted's algorithm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robinson%E2%80%93Schensted_correspondence#The_Schensted_algorithm) to find the length of the longest increasing subsequence, given a large input file.  
The input file is 2,000,000 digits long, so brute force is ridiculously impractical... but it would still work. _Eventually_.  
  
The efficient solution takes over a minute to run on most PCs.
  
##Info to tell teams asking for help
* Hint implies there is a better way to solve (rather than brute force)
* Name of problem is important
