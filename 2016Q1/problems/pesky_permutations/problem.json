In fact, I've fiddled with it so much that I noticed a pattern: If you repeat the same algorithm on the cube, it will eventually return to its original state.<br><br>Can you give me the average number of permutations each algorithm in `perms.dat` takes to return the cube to solved? Round your answer to 2 decimal places and submit without `sctf{}`.<br><br>Good Luck!",
