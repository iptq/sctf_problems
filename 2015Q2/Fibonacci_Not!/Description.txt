What would be a CTF without a typical algorithm problem? This will test your system more than anything. Seeing as the Fibonacci sequence is overused, lets change it slightly shall we?
Given F(x) = G(x) - W(x)
G(x) = [G(x-1)+G(x-2)]^2
W(x) = [W(x-1)]^2 + [W(x-2)]^2
What is F(30)?
G(0) = 0 G(1) = 1
W(0) = 0 W(1) = 1
