Given the file "coin.png" you need to first realize all the extra notes.

Modifications were done to the image thus that no program is able to easily process the notes, so they must be manually extracted.

These notes are actually code in a language made of notes from MIDI files called Velato.

Once taken out of the sheet music, the notes must be converted into a MIDI file and then put through a compiler for this language to get the flag output.

No hints should be given about this problem.
